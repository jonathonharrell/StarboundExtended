## Starbound Extended

This mod really only has two goals: Add more fun, and add more challenge.

That said, I also want it to match the flavor and style and feel like it is part of the actual game.

**Note: Early versions of this mod may seem all-over-the-place with it's features. Don't worry; that's just me learning the modding ropes and seeing what's possible. Features may be replaced or removed entirely as time goes on. No guarantees of stability or compatibility with other mods.

Notes

- Spoke to devs about the following:
  - Monster spawning in groups (currently not possible, but may come in the future)
  - Scripts for trees (won't be possible, but they're adding possible tree interactions in the future)
  - Inventory size (will probably not be possible until devs get around to inventory overhaul)
  - Tech unlock item being different per tech (not currently possible)
