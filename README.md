## Starbound Extended

-- Started over Jan. 16th 2015 with a new premise

The goal of this mod is to provide what I am considering "bang-for-buck" features. Meaning they are easy to implement but provide lots of replayability or extend sections of the game in ways that I, any hopefully others, find enjoyable.
