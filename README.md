## Starbound Extended

This mod really only has two goals: Add more fun, and add more challenge.

**Note: Early versions of this mod may seem all-over-the-place with it's features. Don't worry; that's just me learning the modding ropes and seeing what's possible. Features may be replaced or removed entirely as time goes on.

Changes to Vanilla
==================
- Human eyes are less beady
  - Added eyebrows and sclera
  - Changed UNDY COLOR to EYE COLOR, it now corresponds to both eyes and undies

New Features
============
- New Novakid brands! (currently only 3)
- Bunnies! (brown and white variations)
  - extra cuteness
  - spawns in Garden biome (for now), `/spawnmonster bunny`
- Fireflies!
  - a bug that gives off light!
  - will carry into some of the aesthetic areas of the mod, coming soon TM
  - spawns in Garden biome at night, `/spawnmonster firefly`

Notes
=====
- Current playthrough:
  - Character Creation
    - More hair/fin/flower/etc styles in general
  - Early Game (First Planet)
    - Rename firefly to "lightbug", make light color and texture dynamic
    - Remove bunny from spawning pools - too Earth-like

@todo
======
- Playthrough of vanilla to flesh out the roadmap (in progress)
- Determine how to add inventory space with back items or tech
- Determine how to add mobile storage
- Add more / change  undy / eye colors
- Cherry blossom trees (may need tree scripting)
