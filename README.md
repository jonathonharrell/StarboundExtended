## Starbound Extended

The goal of this mod is to provide what I am considering "bang-for-buck" features. Meaning they are easy to implement but provide lots of replayability or extend sections of the game in ways that I, and hopefully others, find enjoyable and challenging.

Changes to Vanilla
==================
- Lower default inventory space to a total of 10 slots (not including hotbar)
  - makes sure the player is selective about what tools to bring for which activities
  - stretches out some parts of the game
  - ties in with future parts of the mod (storage space upgrades, moveable storage system)

New Features
============
- Bunnies! (brown and white variations)
  - extra cuteness
  - currently no way to see in game other then via admin commands: `/spawnmonster bunny`
- Fireflies!
  - a bug that gives off light!
  - will carry into some of the aesthetic areas of the mod, coming soon TM
  - currently no way to see in game other then via admin commands: `/spawnmonster bunny`
