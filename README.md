## Starbound Extended

This mod really only has two goals: Add more fun, and add more challenge.

**Note: Early versions of this mod may seem all-over-the-place with it's features. Don't worry; that's just me learning the modding ropes and seeing what's possible. Features may be replaced or removed entirely as time goes on.
