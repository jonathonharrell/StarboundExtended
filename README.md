## Starbound Extended

This is a Starbound overhaul mod that aims to make each segment of the game much longer and provide more to do / more gameplay options. There's a sort of lack of direction at the moment, I only know two things for sure: I want stays on planets to last for much longer (no more skimming planets for chests and settlements), and I want things to generally be more difficult (although only where it makes sense and "feels right").

Obviously this is still in its (very) early stages.

EDIT: I should also mention, in case anyone stumbles upon this before it's ready, that I may or may not keep up with it. No promises. Busy schedule, RL duties and all that jazz. But I'll try :)


### Notes:

- Tree script doesn't seem to be called
- Because of animation of placing objects with MM, may need to reenable MM and just reduce or remove resource gathering capabilities (may be able to reduce radius to 0)
