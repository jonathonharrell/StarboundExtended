# Roadmap

These are changes and ideas I've come up with that I'd like to see in game. I don't expect that I'll ever get all of it in and balanced, but I like to have a list of things to cross off as I go. Obviously this is in a state of constant flux and features listed here can and likely will be changed as the mod evolves.


## Pre-game (Character Creation Assets)

Generally expanding character creation is not high priority, as there are plenty of options already. That said, having more choices is great, so when I get chances to I'll work on expanding our options there.

### Human
- More hair styles *IN PROGRESS*
- ~~Fix beady eyes~~ *DONE*

### Hylotl
- More fin styles

### Floran
- More flower styles

### Novakid
- More brands *IN PROGRESS*
- More hair styles
- More colors

### Apex
- More hair styles

### Avian
- More feather styles
- More beaks

### Glitch
- More mask styles

### General
- Tattered clothes for starting
  - Human *IN PROGRESS*
  - Hylotl
  - Floran
  - Novakid
  - Apex
  - Avian
  - Glitch
- More cosmetic back/head items


## General Changes

These changes don't really apply to particular portions of the mod, but are more just other additions that I want to see.

- More clothing options with more complex recipes
- Blood as a liquid
- Better monster on-death animations
- ~~Larger worlds~~ *DONE*


## Progression
