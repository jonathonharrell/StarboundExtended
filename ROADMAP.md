## Pre-game (Character Creation Assets)

Generally character creation expansion is not high priority, as there are plenty of options already. That said, having more choices is great, so when I get chances to I'll work on expanding our options there.

### Human
- More hair styles *IN PROGRESS*
- ~~Fix beady eyes~~ *DONE*

### Hylotl
- More fin styles

### Floran
- More flower styles

### Novakid
- More brands *IN PROGRESS*
- More hair styles
- More colors

### Apex
- More hair styles

### Avian
- More feather styles
- More beaks

### Glitch
- More mask styles

### General
- Tattered clothes for starting (for each race)
- More back items


## General Changes

These changes don't really apply to particular portions of the mod, but are more just other additions that I want to see.

- More clothing options with more complex recipes
- Blood as a liquid
- Better monster on-death animations
- ~~Larger worlds~~ *DONE*


## Progression

Based on the phases of the game seen here: http://www.chucklefish.org/images/BiomeDiagram.png
