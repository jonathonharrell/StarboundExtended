# Roadmap

These are changes and ideas I've come up with that I'd like to see in game. I don't expect that I'll ever get all of it in and balanced, but I like to have a list of things to cross off as I go. Obviously this is in a state of constant flux and features listed here can and likely will be changed as the mod evolves.


## Pre-game (Character Creation Assets)

Generally expanding character creation is not high priority, as there are plenty of options already. That said, having more choices is great, so when I get chances to I'll work on expanding our options there.

## General Changes

These changes don't really apply to particular portions of the mod, but either apply to the mod as a whole or are just neat features I wanted to have/add.

## Progression

Based on the phases of the game seen here: http://www.chucklefish.org/images/BiomeDiagram.png

#### Before "obtain core fragments to fix thrusters"

**On your ship**
During this phase, the user should figure out they start with nothing and the MM has no ability to mine.

- ~~No starter items~~ *DONE*
- Add "Debris" item
  - Add "Debris"
- ~~Remove MM mining ability for early game~~ *DONE*
- ~~Overwrite quests~~ *DONE*

**Initial beam down**
Collect sticks from bushes, rocks and plant fibre to build a crude axe to begin collecting wood

- Add "Hemp"
- Remove farmables except wheat and hemp
- Change early game recipes *IN PROGRESS*
- Add "Stick" *IN PROGRESS*
- Add "Crude Axe"
- Add "stickbush" to gather sticks from *IN PROGRESS*
- Add "Jagged Rock"
- ~~Add "Lightbug" for some source of light early on~~ *DONE*

**First shelter**
- Change campfire as follows:
  - no longer requires torch
  - now requires 5 logs to craft
  - starts in unlit state, cannot interact with in that state and doesn't generate heat
  - use "Flint" on it to change to "lit" state, eventually campfire will die and leave "ash" in that spot
- Add "Flint", requires two jagged rocks
- Log can no longer be made into wood so easily (any ideas?)

LATER:
Windmill
Mill Stone
Mechanical Power system
